# 3D Fireball Particle Simulation & Advanced Data Science Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive Python project that simulates a 3D fireball particle distribution and applies advanced data science techniques to analyze, model, and visualize the data.

---

## Project Overview

* **Simulation**: Generates 5,000 particles arranged in a spherical fireball shape with intensity decreasing from the center outward.
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies PCA and t-SNE to visualize and understand particle distribution and cluster structures.
* **Clustering**: Uses K-Means to identify natural clusters within the particles.
* **Machine Learning Models**:

  * **Regression**: Random Forest Regressor predicts particle intensity based on 3D coordinates.
  * **Classification**: Random Forest Classifier predicts particle cluster assignments.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters for better performance.
* **Model Explainability**: Utilizes Partial Dependence Plots and SHAP values to interpret model predictions.
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Creates dynamic 3D plots with Plotly for intuitive data exploration.
* **Model Persistence**: Saves trained models for future use or deployment.

## Installation

Use the following commands to set up your environment:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly shap joblib
```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the complete simulation and analysis** in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab environment by executing the main script.

2. The workflow includes:

   * Generating particle data with coordinates and intensity
   * Performing PCA and clustering
   * Training and tuning Random Forest models for regression and classification
   * Visualizing results with static and interactive plots
   * Interpreting model predictions using SHAP and Partial Dependence Plots

3. **Interactive plots** can be explored in Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab.
